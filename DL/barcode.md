# Barcode detect, decode using DL

## Some good posts

[Decoding 1-D Barcode from Degraded Images Using a Neural Network](http://what-when-how.com/computer-visionimaging-and-computer-graphics/decoding-1-d-barcode-from-degraded-images-using-a-neural-network-computer-visionimaging-and-computer-graphics-part-1/)


The existing open-source libraries for 1-D barcodes recognition are not able to recognize the codes 
from images acquired using simple devices without autofocus or macro function

ZXing project : best open-source barcode decoed, but still need need autofocus and high resolution

This papaer : use image restoration technique to improve accuracy of Barcode decoder
